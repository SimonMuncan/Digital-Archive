Digital Archive - website

For this website, I was using Python - Django, Javascript, HTML, CSS - Bootstrap

There is a Login page where only users who know the username and password can access the website. The website is protected only for limited users, so there is no option to register on the website.

The website contains an About page, a Contact page, pages that store different audio files sorted in folders, a page that stores blog stories, and a page that shows a PDF book so the user can read it directly from the website or download a PDF. 
Also, there is one page that shows maps and pined places with popups that show info about that place. Every page has its own search so the user can find easily the PDF or audio file that he is looking for etc...
